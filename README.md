You may also roll any amount of the featured starwars dice so that your adventure may unfold into the legendary campaign it was always meant to be.

![Our voyage with backend](./src/assets/readme/backend-header.png)

This project was our capstone project for our final module at Turing, school of software and design. It was our first chance to work on a full-stack team as we were now paired with those who did the backend program at Turing. Our special-feature, exclusive behind-the-scene database may be seen [here](https://github.com/SWRPG-Capstone/swrpg-be). Extra content includes the queries we used to make the magic happen!

**Learning goals:** Our stretch technology chosen for this project was Apollo & GraphQL. I have never used anything outside of RESTful APIs and found this project as an opportunity to expand my knowledge in the area. I also wanted to know what it was like to work amongst an actual backend team for this project.

**Challenges:** Exploring the unknown is always a challenge, especially when involving technlogies that span between both developer stacks. It was fortunate that communication was prominent in our team and we were able to bridge a connection between Apollo and GraphQL. It was challenging that we didn't try to establish this connection more early on. Also, the logic for the dice seemed decievingly easy when establishing the features we needed. Since all of the dice have custom values, we had create a dice mechanic which required a lot of logic for it to be able to operate the way it woud in real life.
